Sample rate is 3 Hz
Measurement time is 60 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 11
Step size for the IV curves is 2.00e-08
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-16 15:45:33.170900
And takes 1.00 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 1.000956e+00 with std 4.969040e-05
Mean temperature is 2.500459e+01 with std 1.189263e-03
One IV-curve took 6.47 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.15 Hz
So 9 IV curve were measured
