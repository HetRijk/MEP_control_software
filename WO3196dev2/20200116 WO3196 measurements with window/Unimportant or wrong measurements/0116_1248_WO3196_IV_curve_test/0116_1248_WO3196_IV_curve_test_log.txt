Sample rate is 3 Hz
Measurement time is 60 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 101
Step size for the IV curves is 1.9999999999999997e-09
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-16 12:48:59.172500
And takes 1.00 minutes
Measurement done
One IV-curve took 44.84 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.02 Hz
So 2 IV curve were measured
