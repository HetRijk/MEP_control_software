Sample rate is 4 Hz
Measurement time is 60 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 11
Step size for the IV curves is 2.00e-08 A
Temperature setpoint is 2.50e+01 C
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-17 15:19:59.274799
And takes 1.00 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 1.000976e+00 with std 2.279448e-05
Mean temperature is 2.500462e+01 with std 1.104574e-03
One IV-curve took 2.57 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.39 Hz
So 22 IV curve were measured
