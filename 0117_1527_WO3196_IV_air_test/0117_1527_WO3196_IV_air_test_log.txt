Sample rate is 4 Hz
Measurement time is 600 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 11
Step size for the IV curves is 2.00e-08 A
Temperature setpoint is 2.50e+01 C
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-17 15:27:36.110799
And takes 10.00 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 1.001011e+00 with std 1.552627e-05
Mean temperature is 2.500456e+01 with std 1.193077e-03
One IV-curve took 2.58 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.39 Hz
So 214 IV curve were measured
