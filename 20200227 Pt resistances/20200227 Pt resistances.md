# 20200227 Pt resistances

Measured the resistance of a couple of Pt depositions on Si/Si02

- Pt 03 nm: Temescal test Victoria
- Pt 02 nm: Temescal test Victoria
- Pt WO3196: Temescal deposition on WO3196 -> 5 nm

Measured partly by using probe station needles and partly by wire bonding to surface and then using needles to measure from PCB
