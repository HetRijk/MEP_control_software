Set supply volume for pressure controller 26-11 untill 28-11

When the pressure controller is given a set volume of gas as high pressure input, it cannot give the main chamber a higher pressure that the one of the given volume. Therefore when the input voltage of the PC corresponds to a higher pressure than the given pressure, the pc should open up completely and give that pressure to the main chamber, while giving off an error beep.
However, the pc lets some amount of gas leak away, therefore the given pressure cannot be maintained infinitely, but after some time the pressure will start to drop.

Measurement details
Start with all chambers under vacuum pressure (here: 0.08 bar)
Prepare air and h2 chambers with 1 bar of gas.
Let them expand into mixing chamber
Give pc a voltage that corresponds to a lower pressure than that of the mixed volume and measure until the pressure starts to drop

Given pressure: 5V
Done at
4V
3V
2V

- How long does it last at each voltage?
