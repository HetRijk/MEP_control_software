Sample rate is 1 Hz
Measurement time is 30.0 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 11
Step size for the IV curves is 2.00e-08 A
Temperature setpoint is 2.50e+01 C
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-16 18:39:29.276900
And takes 0.50 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 9.909818e-01 with std 1.556113e-05
Mean temperature is 2.500448e+01 with std 1.177220e-03
One IV-curve took 11.35 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.09 Hz
So 4 IV curve were measured
