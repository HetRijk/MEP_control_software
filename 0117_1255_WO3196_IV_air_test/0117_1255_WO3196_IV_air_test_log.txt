Sample rate is 50 Hz
Measurement time is 60 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 11
Step size for the IV curves is 2.00e-08 A
Temperature setpoint is 2.50e+01 C
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-17 12:55:48.359799
And takes 1.00 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 1.001000e+00 with std 6.726658e-06
Mean temperature is 2.500462e+01 with std 1.179228e-03
One IV-curve took 2.96 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.34 Hz
So 20 IV curve were measured
