0124_1704_WO3196_iv_drift

Measurement is done with current sourcing
Sample rate is 4 Hz
Sample time has been set to 0.2 s
Measurement time is 600 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 11
Step size for the IV curves is 2.00e-08 A
Temperature setpoint is 2.50e+01 C
Devices connected
Setup completed, now waits for 10
Start measurement at 2020-01-24 17:05:00.972576
And takes 10.00 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 1.000967e+00 with std 1.258974e-05
Mean temperature is 2.500426e+01 with std 1.170150e-03
One IV-curve took 6.36 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.16 Hz
So 88 IV curve were measured
