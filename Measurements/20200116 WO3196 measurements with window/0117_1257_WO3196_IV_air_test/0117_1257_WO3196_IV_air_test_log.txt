Sample rate is 50 Hz
Measurement time is 60 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 11
Step size for the IV curves is 2.00e-08 A
Temperature setpoint is 2.50e+01 C
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-17 12:57:25.682799
And takes 1.00 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 1.001000e+00 with std 2.220446e-16
Mean temperature is 2.500480e+01 with std 1.186660e-03
One IV-curve took 2.95 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.34 Hz
So 20 IV curve were measured
