Sample rate is 3 Hz
Measurement time is 5.0 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 11
Step size for the IV curves is 2.00e-08
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-16 15:43:39.474900
And takes 0.08 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 1.000936e+00 with std 4.810457e-05
Mean temperature is 2.500418e+01 with std 1.028519e-03
One IV-curve took 6.58 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.15 Hz
So 1 IV curve were measured
