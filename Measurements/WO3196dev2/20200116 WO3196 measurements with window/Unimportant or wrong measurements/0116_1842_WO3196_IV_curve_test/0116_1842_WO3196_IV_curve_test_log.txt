Sample rate is 1 Hz
Measurement time is 30.0 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 51
Step size for the IV curves is 4.00e-09 A
Temperature setpoint is 2.50e+01 C
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-16 18:42:32.221900
And takes 0.50 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 9.909838e-01 with std 1.428314e-05
Mean temperature is 2.500484e+01 with std 1.341240e-03
One IV-curve took 50.00 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.02 Hz
So 2 IV curve were measured
