Sample rate is 3 Hz
Measurement time is 60 s
Maximum source current is 1e-07 A
Limit voltage starts at 10.0 V
Number of points per IV curve is 11
Step size for the IV curves is 2.00e-08
Devices connected
Setup completed
Start measurement at 2020-01-16 18:26:05.655900
And takes 1.00 minutes
Measurement done
Mean pressure is 9.909500e-01 with std 1.279204e-05
Mean temperature is 2.500495e+01 with std 1.204811e-03
One IV-curve took 6.52 s to measure
and the actual sample rate was 0.15 Hz
So 10 IV curve were measured
